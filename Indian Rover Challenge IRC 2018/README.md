</br>The goal is to create a robot that can function in harsh environments such as Mars. We concentrated on two tasks during the design process: navigation and excavation. Our design goal for navigation was to develop it in such a way that it could travel around a very abrupt surface. The robot can also dig the soil and collect minerals for excavation. I am honored to be a part of the LU Durbar team.
